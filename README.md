## System_response.py
***Description-*** A class to model different damping scenarios in a mass-spring-damper system. This class calculates damping coefficients and damping ratios for different damping cases (undamped, critically damped, overdamped, underdamped) and
can be extended to calculate system time responses.

## Program1.m
***Description-*** Plots the responses of subjecting a mass-spring-damper system to an initial velocity excitation.

## Program2.m
***Description-*** plots a free vibration system's displacement, velocity, and acceleration versus time after being subjected to some initial conditions

## Program3.m
***Description-*** For a FORCED vibration of a mass-spring-damper system, we can calculate the amplitude of the forced response given the system parameters m, c, k and the system's overall response equation. The system's response is different than the forced response because the system's response only describes the harmonic motion of the system over time. This script solves for the force amplitude.
